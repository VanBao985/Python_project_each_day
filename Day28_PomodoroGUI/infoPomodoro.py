It \'s designed to help people focus on tasks more efficiently by breaking work into short, timed intervals called \"Pomodoros,\" separated by short breaks. It can be particularly effective in minimizing distractions and combating procrastination.
Steps of the Pomodoro Technique:
        1. Choose a Task
        2. Set a Timer (Traditionally 25/50 Minutes)
        3. Work on the Task
        4. Take a Short Break (5/10 Minutes)
        5. Repeat the Cycle
