############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game: 
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here: 
#   https://appbrewery.github.io/python-day11-demo/

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements: 
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created: 
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt


import random as rd
from replit import clear
from art import logo
from time import sleep

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
def deal_card():
    cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
    return rd.choice(cards)

#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input 
#and returns the score. 
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.
def calculate_score(cards):
    #Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) 
    #and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.
    s = sum(cards)
    if s == 21 and len(cards) == 2:
        return 0
    #Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, 
    #remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().
    if s > 21 and 11 in cards:
        cards.remove(11)
        cards.append(1)
    return sum(cards)

#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. 
# If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has 
# a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. 
# If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, 
# then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.
